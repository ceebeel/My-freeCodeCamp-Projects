      <p>It is with a heavy heart that we share the sad news that HeroRAT Magawa passed away peacefully this weekend.
        Magawa was in good health and spent most of last week playing with his usual enthusiasm, but towards the weekend
        he started to slow down, napping more and showing less interest in food in his last days. Magawa had recently
        celebrated his birthday in November, reaching the grand old age of 8.</p>
      <p>All of us at APOPO are feeling the loss of Magawa and we are grateful for the incredible work he’s done. During
        his career, Magawa found over 100 landmines and other explosives, making him APOPO’s most successful HeroRAT to
        date. His contribution allows communities in Cambodia to live, work, and play; without fear of losing life or
        limb. In September 2020, he was formally presented with a PDSA Gold Medal – the highest award for gallantry an
        animal can receive. Last year when Magawa retired, HeroRAT Ronin took up the baton as the new adoption rat.</p>
      <p>Every discovery he made reduced the risk of injury or death for the people of Cambodia. Magawa is an African
        giant pouched rat (Cricetomys ansorgei) that was born in Tanzania at Sokoine University of Agriculture (SUA) in
        November 2013. Since 2000, APOPO has developed its operational headquarters, training and breeding center at SUA
        where all the landmine detection rats are born and trained. This is also home to APOPO’s Innovation department
        that researches and develops the innovative applications and advanced techniques used in existing operations.
        This is where he learned how to find explosives using his amazing sense of smell. Magawa moved to Siem Reap in
        Cambodia in 2016, where he began his career.</p>
      <p>Over 60 million people living in 59 countries from Cambodia to Zimbabwe, do so in daily fear of landmines and
        other remnants of past conflict. Landmines are still inflicting pain and fear to a new generation of Cambodian
        people, a generation that wasn’t even born when these mines were laid. Clearing minefields is intense,
        difficult, dangerous work and demands accuracy and time. This is where APOPO’s animal detection systems can
        increase efficiency and cut costs.</p>
      <p>It is thanks to all of you that Magawa will leave a lasting legacy in the lives that he saved as a landmine
        detection rat in Cambodia. Thank you all, from the bottom of our hearts, for your support during this difficult
        time.</p>

        Magawa’s performance has been unbeaten, and I have been proud to work side-by-side with him. He is small but he
        has helped save many lives allowing us to returns much-needed safe land back to our people as quickly and
        cost-effectively as possible. But he is slowing down, and we need to respect his needs. I will miss working with
        him!</p>
